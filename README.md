# Malaria_detection_using_ConvNet_with_keras

This is a simple implementation of Convnet i.e Convolutional Neural Network to detect based on the cell image, a person is infected with malaria or Not
Why do we have to use Convnets? the answer is becuase ConvNets are based upon the human retina and how brain neurons process the data captured by our retina, Same as the human eye ConvNets detect smaller features from the given image and as our brain neurons ConvNets process the smaller features to generate a unique perspective of the given image and can by training them they can detect objects same as our brain.
Now let's discuss about this dataset , this is a dataset of a collection of cell images that are both infected and uninfected, and given a cell Image we have to detect if it is unfected with malaria or not, so the folder path "/kaggle/input/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria/cell_images/cell_images/Uninfected" contains images of the cells that are not infected by Malaria and the folder path "/kaggle/input/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria/cell_images/cell_images/Parasitized" contains images of the cells that are infected by Malaria.
